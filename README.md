# logo-generator

This is a simple logo generator that creates an SVG file based on the user input. The user can enter up to three characters for the logo text, choose a text color, and select a shape(circle, triangle, square), and choose a shape color. The program then generates an SVG file that includes the text and the selected shape with the chosen colors.

This project was created by Caleb Lapitan. The inquirer and svgwrite packages were used to implement the command-line interface and SVG generation functionality, repectively.
